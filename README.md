CML lab topology for the RADIUS video I did on August 15 2025.

Inlcudes:

- `radius.yaml` the CML topology file (works with CML 2.9.0)
- the "new" default freeRADIUS configuration file that can be put into the
  CML 2.9.0 freeRADIUS container `radiusd.conf` file. Adapt the secret unless
  you want to go with "geheim" (*secret* in German).
